# SceneKit-Test2
This project demonstrates using SceneKit to load a model created by the MakeHuman app and play a skeletal animation recorded in a standard .bvh file associated with that model. This is a very crude demo, but it shows how much can be acconplished with SceneKit, open source tools and a small amount of code.

## Tools Used
